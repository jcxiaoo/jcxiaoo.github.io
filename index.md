## About me

Hi! I am Jian-Ci Xiao (萧建慈), who is currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Mathematics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, collaborating with Professor [De-Jun Feng](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~djfeng/). Before this, I was a PhD student in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Zhejiang University, supervised by Professor [Huo-Jun Ruan](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0002379).

## Research Interests

My interests focus mainly on fractal geometry and related topics, especially:
- Topological and geometric properties of fractal sets
- Dimension theory of fractal sets
