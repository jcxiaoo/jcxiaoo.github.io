## About me

Hi! I am Jian-Ci Xiao (萧建慈), who is currently an associate research fellow in the School of Mathematics at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. During 2022 and 2023, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Mathematics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, collaborating with Professor [De-Jun Feng](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~djfeng/). Before that, I was a PhD student in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Zhejiang University, supervised by Professor [Huo-Jun Ruan](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0002379).

## Research Interests

My interests focus mainly on fractal sets' geometric and topological properties and dimension theory. Some specific topics include the embedding problem of self-similar/self-affine sets, the interiors of self-similar sets and their sumsets or difference sets, homeomorphism criteria between carpet-like fractal sets, etc.
